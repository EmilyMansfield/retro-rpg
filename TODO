GUI System

---	Sort out code repetition and function lengths in gui/menu.hpp

+----	Add background and foreground colours for Menu
+---		Fixed foreground and background colours
-		Make foreground colour dependent on each entry
-		Make foreground colour modifiable on selection, perhaps through the callback return value
		These can't be done without more sophisticated colour setting, such as with escape codes

-	Unify partial row and full row code into one in Menu

-	Replace for loop text filling with setw from iomanip
	Adds unnecessary complexity by repeatedly using streams

-	Implement more relevant container operations in Menu

+-	Make navigate handle empty entries better

--	Perhaps replace hacky (though very cool) callback system in Menu?

+---	Fix bugs with getSize functions

Rendering

Asset Management

---	Properly implement global fonts instead of using a static const in a header

Json

-	Create a nicer JSON interface instead of duplicating save/load code
	Include exceptions too?

--	Make toJson functions type conversions instead?

----	Change all JsonBox save/load functions to pass Objects around, not Values
	A side effect of this is we lose const correctness; using [] breaks const references (and references in general),
	so we cannot pass const references without passing a value then converting it in the function.

-----	Streamline loading of Overworldable entities and their movers (movers created after load)

----	Replace TreasureChest position saving/loading with Mover saving/loading

!-----	Update for newest JSONBox version

General Changes

-	Clean up getters/setters in original tutorial files and protect containers from direct access

-	Fixed unsigned/signed/size_t typing inconsistencies. Pick something, and STICK TO IT!

-	Add namespaces throughout the code, to be consistent with gui

--	Remove unnecessary headers, e.g. debug iostreams
	Completed for gui additions

-	Align comments to 80 character limit and fix general code alignment

----	Make use of `this` consistent

----	Disable key repeating with window.setKeyRepeateEnabled(false)

---	Make keybindings customisable

---	Stop using magic numbers for screen resolution and viewport size

---	Remove return statements at end of void functions

----	Hide irrelevant details of classes and reduce public members

---	Make getAreaPtr return something more robust (weak_ptr or reference?)

---	Make xpToLevel in Player static or xpToNextLevel

-	Add JavaDoc/Doxygen documentation
